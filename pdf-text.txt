along with faster 0-60 times, reducing a vehicles weight also helps deliver lightning-quick
responsiveness and uncanny driving dynamics. Bmws intelligent lightweight engineering gives
the latest generation m3 an enviable weight-to-power ratio of 8.9 lbs/hp. The m3s suspension,
for example, uses weight-optimized components, like an aluminum front axle. The m3 coupes
carbon-
fiber roof weighs 11 lbs. Less than a steel roof, and 45 lbs. Less than a steel moonroof.
By reducing the weight of the roof, bmw lowers the center of gravity, thus minimizing body roll
and enhancing grip through turns.

get behind the wheel of the m3 convertible, and you open up a new world of inspired and exhilarating driving possibilities at every turn.
Thats why bmw offers m drive  to provide a comprehensive array of choices when it comes to personalizing your m3 convertibles driving
feel. Normally, dynamic stability control (dsc) helps to deliver optimal traction, including track-oriented m dynamic mode (mdm), which
allows for more wheelslip and yaw angle. Electronic damping control (edc) can be set to comfort, normal or sport, depending on your

preferred handling settings and the surface of the road. Engine response can be tweaked via a button in the center console, which calls up
normal, sport or sport plus programs. But however you con
gure it, the m3 convertible brings together unmatched levels of responsiveness
and control  as only bmw m can deliver.

Straightaways can become hairpin turns in the blink of an eye. But the m3s suspension design handles whatever the road throws at it with

nesse. At the heart of the m3s responsiveness is a front axle made primarily of aluminum; an additional thrust plate across the entire frame
adds stability, making the front axle not only lightweight, but extremely rigid. The 
ve-arm rear suspension features all-aluminum track control
arms and dampers; compared to construction using more conventional material, its stiffer and 5.5 lbs. Lighter. Anti-roll bars, front and rear,
and two additional longitudinal bars contribute to the m3s powerful, sporty dynamics and road feel. The m3s agile suspension frees the
rest of its innovative, performance-enhancing features to operate to their most thrilling capacity.

The m3s retractable roof is far more than just
a steel version of a softtop. When raised, the full
roo
iner effectively insulates the interior against
cold and exterior noise. At the push of a button
on the center console, a motor electrohydraulically
begins the process of lowering the top. First, the
roof is separated into three sections, which then
smoothly move towards the rear and stack one
above the other. At the same time, the trunklid
unlocks at the front and swings up. The stacked
roof sections are lowered into a special storage
compartment; the trunklid closes. Total time from
top-up to top-down: 22 seconds. The trunk can
now be opened from the back, and gently closed
using the soft-close feature.
The roof can also be raised and lowered by using
the key fob buttons when the m3 convertible
is equipped with comfort access. This option
also includes the comfort opening and loading
feature: to stow large packages in the trunk
when the top is down, a touch of the remote
button raises the stacked roof up and conve-
niently out of the way, letting you access more
trunk space; another press lowers it back down.
All of which makes the m3 convertible hardtop
not just one of the sleekest, most beautiful
convertible hardtops on the road today, but
the smartest, as well.

Speed. Power. Control. Three things on the
mind of every bmw m engineer. In designing
the m3s engine, no corners were cut, and no
boundaries were set. Their efforts resulted in a
powerful 4.0-liter v-8 engine, with a dynamic
414-hp output and 295 lb-ft of available
torque, as well as a maximum engine speed
of 8400 rpm. Its the kind of muscle that will
catapult the m3 convertible from 0-60 in just
5.1 exhilarating seconds.

date
the naturally aspirated engine, the m3 hood
features a contoured powerdome and dual
air intakes.
Thanks to the m3 engine blocks special
aluminum/silicon-alloy construction, the
cylinder surface is created by the exposed
hard silicon crystals in the alloy. This elimi-
nates the need for conventional coated
cylinder bores. For increased structural
stability, the m3 v-8s crankcase is milled
as a complete forging.
To achieve smooth power distribution
through
out the rpm range, the m3s engine
is tuned to truly track-worthy speci
cations.
Bmws double-vanos technology ensures
pinpoint-accurate valve timing, which allows
for optimal combustion at every rev range,
while lowering emissions.
In keeping with the m3s racing-inspired

engineering, eight separate throttle but
ter-

ies operate precisely and independently,
delivering amazingly quick throttle response.
In
addition, the engines oil supply is carefully
regulated by an advanced wet sump system
to ensure adequate lubrication under any
conditions. The result: breathtaking accel-
eration out of the turns and onto the
straightaways.
An equally innovative engine management
system enhances performance. Ion 
ow
technology monitors the v-8s combustion
process via the spark plugs, helping to
prevent knocking. How far can revolutionary
bmw technology take you? Hit the m3s

Bmw m dct drivelogic: a transmission option that is worthy of the
m3s breathtaking driving dynamics.
This 7-speed m double clutch transmission (m dct) with drivelogic
uses two transmission structures in one large housing. First, third,

fth and seventh gears are grouped in one structure; second, fourth
and sixth gears are grouped in the other. When upshifting or down-
shifting, the system switches between the two structures, so that
while one gear is being disengaged, the next is already in position.
And m dct drivelogic can even tailor gear use to your own driving
needs. Choose from 11 different programs: six in sequential mode,
and 
ve in automated mode. In either mode, you can access the
whole spectrum of the m3s track-inspired shifting dynamics.
Even racing fans are impressed with the results: m dct drivelogic
delivers lightning-fast shifts that rocket you to top gear in the blink of
an eye. In manual mode, change gears by using either the shift lever,
or steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters. It shifts like a racecar 
only faster. In sequential mode, the shift times vary, but in the sportiest
programs, seamless shifts take only milliseconds to complete. You
even get a prompt to indicate the ideal moment to change gears.
In auto
mated mode, the system performs shifts auto
matically, with
action so smooth youll barely feel them at all.
In addition to its superior performance on the road, the m dct
drivelogic transmission offers a range of functions for even more
convenience. The lowspeed assistant makes parking easier, while
the auto-p function activates the handbrake once the engine is
turned off, and selects the gear with the highest traction when you
restart your vehicle.

a bmw engineers log while testing the
m3 on the nurburgrings nordschleife:
tuesday morning, 9:13 am, air temperature
58 fahrenheit. Dry asphalt, a cloudy sky.
Press the start/stop button briefly, and the
high-speed v-8 induction engine springs
to life. A glance at the instrument panel. A
glance at the route. Concentrate and: go!
The bmw m3 powers away with a turbine-
like power delivery. Then: hatzenbach.
The first bend on the nordschleife is
unsparing as it lays bare the vehicles
suspension characteristics. Steer sharply
to the right and then to the left. Itll need a
lot more than that to bring this aluminum
chassis off track. The bmw m3 takes the
bend neutrally and accurately.
Onward, up the quiddelbacher-hohe. The
road is narrow and undulating. The bmw m3
speeds up to 124 mph, the engine powers
on ceaselessly. Upsurge: minimal. The aero-
dynamics molds itself around the vehicle
like the m seat around the driver. After flug-
platz and schwedenkreuz, the first tough
braking area by aremberg  and after that,
top speed down the fuchsrohre. The build:
extremely torsion-stiff and bend-resistant.
Fourth mile. Adenauer-forst. Precise, rapid
load change at the limit. Road section breid-
scheid: the cloud cover cracks open, the
high-performance compound brakes
glow 
but stay steady.
Now to the right, up the ex-muhle. The v-8
powerplant revs up, the cooling system shows
no sign of strain. The bmw m3 effortlessly
climbs the steep incline up to bergwerk, on
over kesselchen towards the legendary
steep section: formidable driving stability
 the variable m differential lock performs
brilliantly. Then into the caracciola-karussells
180-degree banked turn: straining right to the
limit  particularly the wheel suspension.

On over wippermann. The handling is almost
playful. To pflanzgarten. Taut, but not tough
 the spring and damper tuning. Finally
antoniusbuche, a long stretch, top speed
155 mph, the road studded with bumps.
Superb longitudinal dynamics. Then the
finish line is in sight. Hands tremble. The
new bmw m3 falls silent. The v-8 engine
crackles softly.

when is a sporty vehicle considered truly
high performance? When every component
works together seamlessly. Thats where
the m3 shines. At the heart of the m3s
responsive handling lies a front axle made
primarily of
aluminum, including the central
subframe, the spring struts, the swivel bear-
ings, and an additional thrust plate across
the entire frame for added stability. As a result,
the front axle is not only lightweight, its
extremely rigid.
Redesigned from the ground up  except for a
single trailing link borrowed from the 3 series
platform  the 
ve-arm rear axle features all-
aluminum track control arms, as well as

aluminum dampers. And when compared to
construction using more conventional materi-
als, the rear axle is stiffer and 5.5 lbs. Lighter.
Optimized for weight and stability, anti-roll
bars are featured in both the front and rear
of the m3s chassis. Once again, special

engineering of the axle geometry (which

features two additional longitudinal bars)

contributes to the m3s powerful, sporty
dynamics and road feel.
Working in conjunction with the suspension,
the m3s 
nal drive features a variable m

differential lock, which provides up to 100 %
locking action for optimal traction on any

surface, in any conditions.
The suspension design allows the rest of the
vehicles innovative, performance-enhancing
features  from the heavy-duty manual trans-
mission to the m3 coupes carbon-
ber roof
 to operate at their most thrilling capacity.
Its the solid foundation that plays a huge
role in the m3s unmatched driving dynamics.

chassis i lightweight construction
the roof of the bmw m3 coupe is made
of carbon-
ber-reinforced material,
which is both light and very stiff.
Bmws use of lightweight construction:
track control arms and dampers on the rear
axle are made from lightweight aluminum,
as is the load-through. The rear bumper
carrier is made of a composite material,
long-
ber thermoplastic. Perforated
compound brake discs also contribute
towards a reduction in weight.
The front bumper carriers, which are made from
composite material, and the double-joint spring-
strut front axle, constructed from aluminum, are
as important to the overall lightweight concept
as the aluminum hood.

the m3 bene
ts from lightweight construction
 in its suspension, its perforated compound
brake discs, aluminum hood, and even its
composite front fenders. But just reducing
weight isnt enough to optimize a vehicles
driving dynamics. Thats why bmw reduced
weight in areas where it would have a positive
effect on driving characteristics. M-style agility
is achieved by concentrating the vehicles
weight as close as possible to its center of
gravity. Accordingly, bmw used carbon-
ber
reinforced material  a particularly light and
extremely rigid high-tech composite  in the
roof of the m3 coupe, to lower the vehicles
center of gravity. And when combined with
the m3s near-perfect 50/50 balance front and
rear, the advantages of lighter weight and a
lower center of gravity become obvious in
the m3s powerful drive, high-revving pickup,
improved roadholding and shorter braking

distances.

the very first bmw m  the legendary m1 
shot straight to the top in 1978 as one of the
fastest german road-going sports cars. And
once bmw m tasted success, they never
wanted to give it up.
Uncompromising and practical, with exceptional
quality down to the smallest detail, m cars offer
bmw motorsport technology in a production
vehicle. For over three decades, m cars have
been created for those who view outstanding
achievement as an everyday occurrence.
The bmw m3 made its initial debut in 1987,
and from the very beginning, its performance
was unrivaled. With a 192-hp, 16-valve, four-
cylinder engine, the m3 legend was created.
The second bmw m3 was launched in 1995,
a milestone distinguished by its 240 hp and
array of technological highlights.

bmw m3, 2001  2006
bmw m3, from 2007
in 2001, the third-generation bmw m3
set the benchmark for combining the thrill
of motorsport and everyday functionality.
At its heart was a high-revving, 333-hp,
six-cylinder engine. And today, the 414-hp,
v-8 m3 continues the bmw m tradition.
The engine, transmission, suspension and
aerodynamics are all in perfect harmony.
This powerful high-rev concept with its
unique lightweight technology transfers
motorsport innovation directly to the road.
Thats why bmw m develops and tests its cars
on the notorious nurburgring nordschleife.
This is where racing legends  and cars that
carry the m name  are born.
Bmw m: inspirational vehicles that are prized
on the race circuit  and on the road home.

the lowered chassis and modi
ed control systems provide a noticeable dynamic boost.
Feel the passion that races through the m3 competition package. Developed to take the m3 sedan
and coupe to the far edge of street-legal, it enhances the m3s athletic stance by lowing the suspension
10 mm (0.39 inch) for enhanced aerodynamics. Performance-enhancing technologies include electronic
damping control (edc)  which, along with dynamic stability control (dsc), offers a special sport mode
 while sporty 19" y spoke (style 359m) forged alloy wheels reduce unsprung weight.
